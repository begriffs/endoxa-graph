    // javascript code
    var EndoxaGraph = require('endoxa-graph');
    // have fun
```

On the **client** side

```sh
    # command line
    bower install endoxa-graph
```

```js
    // javascript code
    require(['endoxa-graph'], function(EndoxaGraph) {
      // have fun
    });
```

On the **developer** side

```sh
    # command line (use "sudo" if necessary)
    npm install
    
    # install grunt (use "sudo" if necessary)
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    
    # make sure everything installed correctly
    grunt test
```

### do things in the right order

When you get dressed you have to do some things before others.

OK, so what order should you do it? Ask endoxa:

```js
    EndoxaGraph.toposort(
      EndoxaGraph.fromConnectionsList([
        [0, 6],
        [1, 6],
        [2, 0], [2, 1],
        [3, 0], [3, 7],
        [4, 3], [4, 7],
        [5, 7]
      ])
    );
    // -> [5, 4, 3, 7, 2, 1, 0, 6]
```

## About EndoxaJS

Endoxa means *established wisdom*. This collection of modules form an
elegant base for JavaScript functional programming on both the client
and server. The idea is that abstractions need to prove themselves in
substantial code, and this library works backwards from interesting
algorithms to the abstract nonsense that makes it beautiful.
